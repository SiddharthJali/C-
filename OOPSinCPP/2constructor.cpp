// Constructor is a special method that is invoked automatically at the time of object creation.
// It is used to initialize the data members of new objects generally.

// Access Modifiers are used to implement an important aspect of Object-Oriented Programming known as Data Hiding.
// Access Modifiers or Access Specifiers in a class are used to assign the accessibility to the class members, i.e.,
// they set some restrictions on the class members so that they canâ€™t be directly accessed by the outside functions.
